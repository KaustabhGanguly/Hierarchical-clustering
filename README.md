# Hierarchical-clustering
I used the Hierarchical model using dendrograms in both Python and R


## It's an agglomerative and decisive process 

## The steps I followed are :
- Make each point a single point cluster , that forms N cluster
- Take two data points and make them 1 cluster . That forms N - 1
- Take the 2 closest clusters and make them one cluster . That forms N-2
- Repeat last step till 1 cluster 
- END

# The threshold in the dendrogram decide how many cluster
